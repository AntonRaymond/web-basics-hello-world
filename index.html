			<h4>Bonus things to do if you're hungry for more </h4>
			<p>None of these ideas have examples or hints on where to write the code (so you'll have to figure out what to do on your own -- Google is your friend here).

			<br>Add some more information to the page. Write a couple of paragraphs about yourself. Add some stock photos of people riding horses. Add a link to your favourite youtube video... Play around with the html a bit.
			<br>Make the page less ugly. Write some css to make the layout nicer. Use a prettier font for all the text. Change the colours up. Experiment with what you can do.
			<br>Make the page display the current time (updated every second)
			<br>Build a number guessing game into the page. Rules:
			<ul>
				<li>Computer picks random number between 1 and 100</li>
				<li>Player has 6 lives</li>
				<li>Player attempts to guess the number</li>
				<li>Game says 'too high', 'too low', or 'you win!'</li>
				<li>If the guess is incorrect: player looses a life and they get to guess again</li>
				<li>When lives run out the game is over</li>
			<br>Customise the trivia game to be multi-choice instead of true or false (generate a new api url here: https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
			<br>Can extend this to allow the player to choose the trivia category before they begin the trivia game
